## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

Welcome to my full-stack thread clone built with modern web technologies. This project leverages Next.js for server-side rendering and a seamless user experience, combined with MongoDB for managing data and Redis for caching the most popular threads to ensure optimal performance.

File uploads are handled using Uploadthing, while Shadcn UI and TailwindCSS power the sleek, responsive interface. User authentication is managed via Clerk, providing a secure and streamlined login experience.

The application architecture is designed for scalability and flexibility, using Serverless APIs and Webhooks to handle various interactions, along with form management through React Hook Form and validation with Zod. Everything is built using TypeScript for robust, type-safe code.
